			<p>I&rsquo;ve been working remote since May 2014. I thought it would be good to publish my experience. For the most part everything has been positive. There are some negatives to address though. My situation, like most, is unique.</p>

<p>When my wife (girlfriend at the time) and I decided we wanted to move from Alberta to Ottawa, ON I thought I would need to look for a new job. I wasn&rsquo;t happy about this because I do like my job at <a href="http://www.tronia.com/">Tronia Systems Ltd.</a>. I don&rsquo;t remember if my Manager approached me with the idea of working remote, or if it was my idea. Either way we decided to at least give it a trial run.</p>

<p>I do have to thank the team at Tronia for running this remote experiment with me. If they hadn&rsquo;t kept an open mind about it who knows where I&rsquo;d be today. I&rsquo;m happy with where I&rsquo;m at, so gratitude is required.</p>

<p>The trial run has extended to over two and a half years. So I&rsquo;d say the trial has been successful. I&rsquo;ve been productive. I feel that I&rsquo;ve provided the company equal, or better value working from home.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m the only employee at Tronia working remote. Everyone else works in our St. Albert, AB office. This can likely been seen as a negative but actually works ok. I stay in close communication with my team using email, Slack and Skype. I&rsquo;ll admit that this doesn&rsquo;t equal in-person communication and the nuance that that provides. I rarely feel out of the loop, but it does happen.</p>

<p>We all know how important communication is. Some communication cannot be done through email/chat app/video chat etc. Emotions are hard to transmit through a wire. If I&rsquo;m flustered or frustrated it&rsquo;s hard for me to complain electronically. Before my workmates could see my state. Now, it&rsquo;s harder to convey what I&rsquo;m feeling. I probably need to get better at this.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also the only employee at Tronia who lives and works in a different Time Zone. I&rsquo;m on Eastern Time and the office is on Mountain Time. There is always a two hour difference. Usually this means I start and end my day two hours before everyone else.</p>

<p>I think this is a positive. In the morning I get two hours uninterrupted. My morning hours are usually my most productive. So this is a good time for me to be working on my own.</p>

<p>The flip side is usually I have a whole pile of email waiting for me when I start in the morning. It&rsquo;s not as if my overall workload has grown. It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s shifted by a couple of hours. Split between two days.</p>

<p>Meetings can be another challenge. If there is an afternoon meeting called it&rsquo;s possible that I will be extending my work day. I&rsquo;d like to say I prepare ahead of time and start my day later. When I know there is going to be a late meeting. Yet I&rsquo;m set in my routine, and rarely do this.</p>

<p>I mentioned routine. One of the things I feel has kept me successful working from home is my routine. I keep the same hours I used to in the office. I start at around 8:00 AM everyday. I have lunch at around the same time. I end my day at around the same time. I also prepare for my work day much the same as I used to. That includes a shower, healthy (mostly) breakfast, and getting dressed like a proper adult.</p>

<p>I never did fall into that work from home in your pajama&rsquo;s cliché. Well, ok one time I did but I was under the weather and probably should have been resting anyway.</p>

<p>One of the huge advantages of working from home is that I don&rsquo;t have to commute. I can&rsquo;t overstate how much I love this. My commute before wasn&rsquo;t too bad. It was a good distance but mostly clear highway. Not a great commute, but not the worst. I do not miss it at all. If I were to go back to the office I would do my best to move close. Walking distance if I could.</p>

<p>So, would I want to go back to the office? Sure. Would I rather stay working from home? Probably. What&rsquo;s important to me is I am productive. Providing value to my employer and in turn to our customers (we have an awesome customer base).</p>

<p>One last thing&hellip;</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The best part about working from home is being able to walk out of your office and give your wife and kids a hug.</p>&mdash; David Walsh (@davidwalshblog) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidwalshblog/status/801472143447965696">November 23, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>This, I feel, cannot be understated.</p>
